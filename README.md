Have you ever wondered what happens to a drop of water after it falls from the sky? Where does it go and how does it interact with other drops? If you are curious about these questions, you might want to check out YooDrop, a program that simulates the global water cycle in a fun and interactive way.

## Product

Website : https://yoodrop.com

YooDrop is composed by different components: Engine, Backend, Frontend, and Mobile App. The Engine is the core of the program, where the physics and chemistry of water are modeled using state-of-the-art algorithms. The Backend is the server that stores and manages the data of each drop and user. The Frontend is the web interface that allows you to access YooDrop from any browser. The Mobile App is the application that lets you track your drop on your smartphone or tablet.

YooDrop is more than just a simulation program. It is also a social platform where you can connect with other users who share your interest in water. You can chat with them, exchange tips and insights, and even trade drops. You can also participate in challenges and competitions to earn rewards and badges.
